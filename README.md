# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The goal of the projects was to quickly and efficiently open a file, parse the file, put the information on the file into a data structure like a binary tree, and display the information upon request.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
There were multiple different options to choose from when it came to putting the file's information into a data structure. The two most notable being binary trees and vectors. After doing some calculations for runtime and memory, I found that the binary tree, while slower, was more efficient at storing data and therefore I chose to use it in the final project.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
There were quite a few roadblocks I encountered while going through this course, but the one thing I kept coming back to was the textbook. There I was able to find just about everything I needed in order to create the final project.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project opened my eyes to how efficiently programs run and how much memory they use. I have never made a project that takes a lot of time to run or uses a lot of memory, but these are things that should always be in the back of my mind while developing.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project enforced the habit of making readable code and putting comments to make it easier for other developers to understand what is happening. I will continue to do this as I believe this is a very good practice to make into a habit.
